# CHE629_bd_assignment
Computational homework assignment #2 for CHE 629, 2021

To run this code, you have the same options as on [the previous homework]:
 - Install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) if you haven't already
 - Download this repository: `git clone https://github.com/atravitz/CHE629_bd_assignment`
 - Create a virtual environment with the needed software: `conda env create -f CHE629_bd_assignment/environment.yml`
 - Activate the environment: `conda activate hoomd-soft-matter-2021` 
 - Add Jupyterlab (if you don't have it installed already): `conda install jupyterlab -c conda-forge -y` 
 -  Launch Jupyterlab: `jupyter lab .` within the `CHE629_bd_assignment/` directory
 
 
As an alternative, you can run everything virtually using [this mybinder link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/atravitz/CHE629_bd_assignment.git/main
), but you won't be able to save your progress.
